REVISION HISTORY [Ross Paterson]

I originally wrote this interpreter to have a well-behaved implementation
of a simple functional language for use with an undergraduate course.

31 Jul 1988     initial version used in CS225 at UofQ

31 Jan 1989     added type, abstype, private, parameterless definitions

 4 Mar 1989     added operator sections

16 Jul 1989     general clean-up; use of "Standard" module

25 Jul 1989     #ifdef AMIGA sections [Bill Segall, Ross]

 6 Nov 1989     back end rewritten to use a Krivine machine;
                simplification of pattern compilation.  [Ross, Andrew Moran]
                output & comparison functions in "Standard". 

11 Mar 1990     edit command, and re-editing (RE_EDIT)

 3 Jul 1990     switched from reference counting to mark-scan garbage
                collection;
                added letrec/whererec; num as double. 

10 Mar 1991     improved re-editing (inspired by the Mocka system).
                re-organization of pattern matching, including best-fit
                and more efficient character matching.
                n+k pattern as abbreviation for succ^k(n).
                replaced update markers with stack frames.

12 Jan 1993     added curried function definitions.
                caught redefinition of values as constructors/constants
                and vice versa.
                changed treatment of primed type variables.

19 Jan 1993     regular types (i.e. type synonyms may be recursive).
                lazy expansion of type synonyms.

22 Feb 1993     'dec' declarations may be fulfilled by data constructors.

21 Apr 1993     automatic declaration and definition of 'map' functions
                corresponding to type and type constructor identifiers.
                They may be overridden with explicit definitions.

 4 Nov 1993     support for UTF-encoded Unicode characters.

25 Mar 1994     curried data and type constructors.
                made 'compare' available.

 1 Jul 1994     added options for use in a CGI.

15 Dec 1994     small extension to recursive type synonyms: permutations
                of arguments now allowed in recursive uses.

15 Mar 1995     cyclic types now printed using mu-notation.
                added mu-expressions.

16 Aug 1995     added the black hole optimization.

11 Jun 1997     added -f command line argument, #! hack and argv.

16 Apr 1999     cleanup, autoconf, GPL.

HISTORY OF HOPELESS [Alexander Shabarshin]

26 Jun 2007     fork named "Hopeless" (see http://www.funnylang.org)
                option -v prints new name and version
                interactive command "write" does not print quotatons now
                new interactive command "help" prints list of available commands

27 Jun 2007 >>> RELEASED HOPELESS v0.1

01 Sep 2007     function "read" now can run commands (if filename starts with !)
                new example test/_run.hop demonstrates #!/..., argv and read("!...")

02 Sep 2007 >>> RELEASED HOPELESS v0.2

03 Sep 2007     new example test/_input.hop demonstrates input from keyboard (stdin)

04 Sep 2007     fixed lib/lines.hop to skip '\r'
                new library lib/system.hop and lib/system_win.hop (functons "getc" and "gets")

11 Sep 2007     new library lib/string.hop (right now only to define type "string")
                added function "dir" to lib/system.hop and lib/system_win.hop

05 Apr 2008     new predefined list "env" with some environment variables for CGI

21 Jun 2008 >>> RELEASED HOPELESS v0.3

22 Jun 2008     separate file version.h for APPNAME and VERSION macros
                longer supported filenames (now 256 instead of 100)
                more simultaniously supported streams (now 100 instead of 20)
                restricted mode (-r) now allows reading, but disables running commands ("!...")
                now "mktemp" is used to create temporary filename for running commands
                more available variables in "env" for CGI mode

22 Jun 2008 >>> RELEASED HOPELESS v0.4

24 Jun 2008     added '\r' to function "isspace" in ctype.hop
                fixed function "dir" in system_win.hop

03 Jun 2009     path to libraries changed to /usr/local/share/hopeless
                created man file hopeless.1 (modified hope.1)
                fixed "make install" for Hopeless

28 Aug 2009     new library lib/db_sqlite.hop (database support with sqlite3)

29 Aug 2009     added functions "del" and "write_to" to lib/system.hop
                check for '\n' and '\r' before run commands ("!...")

03 Sep 2009     defined constant "stdin" instead of functions "getc" and "gets" (lib/system.hop)
                modified test _input.hop

06 Sep 2009	modified function "write_to" in lib/system.hop

03 Apr 2010	created git repository (original, v0.1, v0.2, v0.3, v0.4, current)
		fixed AUTHORS and README

04 Apr 2010 >>> RELEASED HOPELESS v0.5

04 Jul 2011	fixed conflict with new GCC (function getline)

24 Mar 2012	extended lib/string.hop (added bunch of useful functions)
		modified lib/db_sqlite.hop and lib/system.hop ("getc" and "gets" are back, "stdin" removed)
		reverted test _input.hop
		fixed AUTHORS and README
		returned folder "doc" with reference manual and tutorial (removed latex2html option)
